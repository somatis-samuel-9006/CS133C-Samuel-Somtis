DESIGN:	

This assignment's purpose is to learn about the various common data types that are used in C. This includes chars,
ints, floats and doubles, longs, etc. The task at hand was to create simple variables of these common data types and
print them to the console. All that was needed was to declare a few simple variables of different types, assign them
values, and print them with the printf function. Research into C's various data types and their identifiers was needed.

TESTS:

Input	Expected	Output
%d	integer		integer
%f	float		float
%u	unsigned	unsigned
%lli	long long	long long
%c	character	character
%s	char array	char array

REFLECTION:

I didn't learn too much from this week's assignment as I'd already dabbled lightly in C before starting this class.
I was able to create various data type variables and print them with the proper type identifiers without any trouble.
This assingment was good practice though, as using these data types is something that will show up in every C program.
