REFLECTION:

My design ended up looking fairly similar to the original design that I created. From design to implementation, I had 
to learn a few new things, such as how to build arrays using C syntax and how to validate textual input. For textual
input validation, I had a few options, such as checking the range of the character's ASCII values, and using isalpha(). I
ended up going for isalpha(). I tested my program by giving it valid and invalid input in a variety of different patterns
to ensure that my program handled every situation that it needed to properly.
